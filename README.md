# Funkin': Feather

![repo-size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/BeastlyGhost/FNF-Funkin-Feather)

A rewrite of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

**Note: Funkin': Feather, in its current state, is not ready for mod use and is unfinished**.

---
Made for learning purposes and as a love letter for Friday Night Funkin's modding community.
While still being very early in development, feedback and help with this project is appreciated.

The base game won't be included with Funkin': Feather, as it's made specifically for mods and mods *only*.
However, it will be distributed separately, like a mod in it of itself.
