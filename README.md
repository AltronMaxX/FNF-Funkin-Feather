# Funkin': Feather
A Work In Progress rewrite of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

-------------------------------
Made for learning purposes and as a love letter for Friday Night Funkin's modding community!
While still being very early in progress, feedback and help with this project is appreciated.

The base game won't be included with the project, as it's made specifically for mods and mods *only*.
However, it will be distributed separately, like a mod in it of itself.

-------------------------------
Pull requests and new issues are greatly appreciated, as I, BeastlyGhost, wanna push the project further until it's in a useable state for both me and mod creators that may make use of the engine!
