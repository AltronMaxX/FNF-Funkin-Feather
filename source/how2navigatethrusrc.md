# "Where are the files?", you might ask.

Well, they are organized and situated in their own repesctive folders.

- Wanna mess with the main game?
  - Go to `source/funkin/`.

- Wanna check the engine's utilities and mess with backend files, e.g. the FPS Counter?
    - Go to `source/base/`.
-------------------------------
If you think that it's hard to nagivate through the `source/` folder, then, hit `CTRL + Shift + P` to access the `Search Editor` in Visual Studio Code.

Delete the `>` symbol at the beginning, insert the name of the file, hit `Enter` and it'll take you there!
