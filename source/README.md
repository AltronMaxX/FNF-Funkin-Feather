Â´"Where are the files"` you might ask

well, they are all organized inside their respective folders

wanna mess with the main game? then go to the "funkin" folder

wanna check engine utilities and mess with backend files (like: FPS Counter)? then go to the "base folder

if you think it's hard to get through the files quickly, simply press CTRL+SHIFT+P, delete the first > symbol, type the file name you want and it will take you there!
