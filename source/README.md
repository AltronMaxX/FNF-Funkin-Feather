## "Where are the files?", you might ask.

Well, they are organized and situated in their own repesctive folders.

-   Wanna mess with the main game?

    -   Go to `source/funkin/`.

-   Wanna check the engine's utilities and mess with backend files, e.g. the FPS counter?
    -   Go to `source/funkin/backend/`.

If you think that it's hard to nagivate to the correct file quickly, then, hit `CTRL + P` to access the `Search File Tool` in Visual Studio Code.
