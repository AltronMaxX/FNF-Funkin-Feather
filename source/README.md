## "Where are the files?", you might ask.

Well, they are organized and situated in their own repesctive folders.

- Wanna mess with the main game?
  - Go to ``source/funkin/``.

- Wanna check the engine's utilities and mess with backend files, e.g. the FPS Counter?
  - Go to ``source/funkin/backend/``.
-------------------------------

If you think that it's hard to nagivate to the correct file quickly, then, hit ``CTRL + Shift + P`` to access the ``Search Editor`` in Visual Studio Code.

Delete the ``>`` symbol, insert the name of the file, hit ``Enter`` and it'll take you there!
