  if you have never seen a YAML file before, or just never had any interaction with those
  Welcome!, YAML files are what control a good chunk of data related bits in my engine
  from Titlescreen Texts to entire menu resource files, YAML files tend to be more readable than JSONs
  so that's why i've choosen to attach various bits of data to said files

  Currently, YAML files are used for
  - Title Screen Introduction Texts
  - Main Menu with very simple Data Functions to control background and menu items
  
  in the future, YAML files will be used to handle Week Data and (if enough support is given) full song charts!

  I highly encourage you to try and learn the syntax for this format as it can be very useful
  if you are going to work with the engine in the future
